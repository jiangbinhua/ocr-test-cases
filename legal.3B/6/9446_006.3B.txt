 To the extent that EPSTEIN, WOOD & COMPANY advances disbursement costs relating
to the legal proceedings, interest shall accrue on any such disbursements at 15% per annum from the
dates those obligations are incurred.

 You shall be entitled to deduct outstanding disbursements and any accrued interest as
a first charge against any proceeds from the claim received from time to time.

IV   DISMISSAL OF SOLICITORS BY CLIENT

 I understand that I have the right to change solicitors or to require that you cease acting
on my behalf.  If I do either of these things, you will be entitled to render an account for the reasonable
value of services rendered up to that point, but that account must be reasonable in the context of what
might ultimately have been your fee if you had handled my case to completion.

 You may elect to withhold my file until any account you render is paid subject only to
assessment (taxation) of the amount as set out in Part VIII, or until arrangements for payment acceptable
to you have been agreed upon.  I agree that your account shall constitute a first charge against any
proceeds of settlement or judgment that are obtained in connection with this matter.

V WITHDRAWAL BY SOLICITORS

 (a)  I understand that you shall be permitted at any time to cease acting for
      me.  That decision shall be in your sole discretion.  In such a case,
      subject only to paragraph (b), no account for fees will be rendered and
      you will release to me all appropriate file material, provided that your
      disbursement accounts have been paid or arrangements satisfactory to
      you have been made with respect to payment of those disbursement
      accounts.
     
 (b)  I agree that you are also at liberty to cease acting at any
      time if, in your view, I am refusing to accept a 
      reasonable settlement offer.  If you exercise this right,
      no account for fees will be rendered at that time and
