I.

POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

 Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 1007 requires that
schedules and statements of affairs of the Debtor be filed within
fifteen (15) days of the petition in a voluntary case.  FRBP 1007
provides that:

  Any extension of time for filing of the
 schedules and statements may be granted only
 on a motion for cause shown and upon notice to
 the United States Trustee and to any committee
 elected pursuant to Section 705 or appointed
 pursuant to 1102 of the Code, trustee,
 examiner, or other parties as the court may
 direct.

 In the present case, the deadline for filing Debtor's
statements and schedules was April 17, 1995.  Due to circumstances
beyond Debtor's control, the schedules and statements of affairs
were not filed until May 2, 1995.  Because the Clerk of Court
automatically set a Motion to Discuss, Debtor brings the matter on
for consideration to moot the Motion to Discuss.

II.

CONCLUSION

 In light of the foregoing, Debtor respectfully requests this
Court enter an order granting the Debtor an extension up to and
including May 2, 1995.


Respectfully submitted,
