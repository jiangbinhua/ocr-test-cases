6.  All commissions shall be earned, due and payable in full upon closing of escrow.

7.  If a licensed real estate broker other than CROWN is the effective procuring cause of any sale
of the PREMISES covered by this agreement, CROWN shall use his best efforts to have such
other broker agree to accept, as its compensation, an equitable portion of the commission payable
to CROWN pursuant to this agreement, and if such other broker so agrees, we will pay CROWN
the commission set forth in paragraph 5 above out of which CROWN will pay to such other
broker its agreed upon share and retain the balance of the commission as CROWN'S
compensation.  If the other broker will not agree to accept, as its compensation, an equitable
portion of CROWN's commission, then our approval will be necessary if the proposal is to be
further negotiated. In no event shall CROWN be liable for the failure to obtain such other
broker's agreement to accept, as its compensation, an equitable portion of the commission payable
to CROWN.

8.  In the event we sell or otherwise dispose of our interest in the above mentioned premises, we
shall remain liable for payment of the commissions provided for in this Agreement unless the
purchaser or transferee assumes all of such obligations in writing.

9.  This agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns.

10.  Each signatory to this Agreement represents and warrants that he or she has full authority to
sigh this Agreement on behalf of the party for whom he or she signs and that this Agreement binds
such party.

If the foregoing accurately sets forth our agreement, please sign and return the enclosed copies of
this letter.

Very truly yours,
