ARTICLE VIII

PARTICIPANT ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS

 8.01. BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  Any Participant may from
time to time designate, in writing, any person or persons,
contingently or successively, to whom the Trustee shall pay his
Accrued Benefit (including any life insurance proceeds payable to
the Participant's Account) on event of his death.  A married
Participant's Beneficiary designation is not valid after
December 31, 1984, unless the Participant's spouse consents (in a
manner described in Section 6.05) to the Beneficiary designation,
or unless the Participant and his spouse are not married throughout
the one (1) year period ending on the date of the Participant's
death. The spousal consent requirement in the immediately
preceding sentence does not apply if a married Participant's spouse
is the Participant's sole primary Beneficiary.  The Advisory
Committee shall prescribe the form for the written designation of
Beneficiary and, upon the Participant's filing the form with the
Advisory Committee, it effectively shall revoke all designations
filed prior to that date by the same Participant.
 8.02. NO BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION.  If a Participant fails
to name a Beneficiary in accordance with Section 8.01, or if the
Beneficiary named by a Participant predeceases him or dies before
complete distribution of the Participant's Accrued Benefit, then
the Trustee shall pay the Participant's Accrued Benefit in
