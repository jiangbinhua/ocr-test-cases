the Leases or any interest therein or any of the rents hereunder.

to any of the Leases without the prior written approval of Lender,
unless it is infeasible for Borrower to obtain such consent within

to grant said consent and failure to grant said consent would
result in the termination of any such Lease, reduction of the
rental payable thereunder, or an impairment of the security
provided Lender hereby.

commenced or pending any suit or action affecting any Lease or the
leasehold created thereby, or any part thereof, or the title
thereto, or if any adverse claim for or against the Leased
Property, or any part thereof, be made or asserted, it will appear
in and defend any such matter purporting to affect the same and
will pay all costs and damages arising because of such action.  If
Lender elects to appear in any such proceeding, Lender shall
control such action or defense.  Any such appearance of Lender
shall be at Borrower's sole cost and expense.
