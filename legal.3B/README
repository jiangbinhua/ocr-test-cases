This README file contains general information regarding the file naming
conventions used on all volumes in this collection.  For specific information
about the contents of individual volumes, consult the file(s) README.Vn on
the appropriate CD.


Explanation of Filenames Used in Samples:
-----------------------------------------

	A sample page is identified by a page id of the form DDDD_PPP where
	DDDD indicates the document number, and PPP indicates the page number
	within the document.

	A given page has multiple TIFF image files:

	    From a Fujitsu M3096G scanner

		DDDD_PPP.2B	200 dpi binary, fixed thresholding
		DDDD_PPP.3B	300 dpi binary, fixed thresholding
		DDDD_PPP.4B	400 dpi binary, fixed thresholding
		DDDD_PPP.3G	300 dpi 8-bit grayscale
		DDDD_PPP.3A	300 dpi binary, Fujitsu adaptive thresholding

	    From a Xerox 7024 fax machine

		DDDD_PPP.SF	standard-mode fax
		DDDD_PPP.FF	fine-mode fax

	There is an ASCII zone file for each image file (except .3A files):

		DDDD_PPP.2BZ
		DDDD_PPP.3BZ
		DDDD_PPP.4BZ
		DDDD_PPP.3GZ
		DDDD_PPP.SFZ
		DDDD_PPP.FFZ

        There is one ASCII ground-truth text file for each zone defined on
	the page.  The ground-truth for the first zone defined in a zone file
	can be found in DDDD_PPP.Z01.  The ground-truth for the second zone can
        be found in DDDD_PPP.Z02, and so on.

	A complete list of page ids is stored in PAGES.  The files PAGES_1,
	PAGES_2, ..., PAGES_5 indicate which pages belong to which Page Quality
	Groups.  For the Spanish Newspaper Sample, the files PAGES.ARG,
	PAGES.MEX, and PAGES.SPA indicate which pages originated in Argentina,
	Mexico, and Spain, respectively.

	Lastly, ZTYPES contains a list of the zone types that were used when
	manually zoning the pages of a sample.
