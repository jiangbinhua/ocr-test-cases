 In the event that Landlord claims that Tenant is indebted 
to Landlord for any sum pursuant hereto and Tenant denies either
the existence of such liability or the amount thereof or Tenant
does not pay the amount claimed on the date required herein or, if
no date is specified, on demand, Landlord may require that the
existence and/or amount or such liability be determined by
arbitration and Tenant agrees that such dispute shall be resolved
by arbitration if Landlord so elects.  Landlord shall exercise such
election by submitting the matter to arbitration pursuant to the
rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Such matters shall
be arbitrated and determined in accordance with the rules of such
Association; provided, however, that the arbitrator may only
consider and determine the particular matter submitted and shall
have no power to modify, alter or vary from the terms of this
Lease.  Such arbitration shall be conducted in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof.
