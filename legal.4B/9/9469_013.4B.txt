                         SECTION 9.
                         TAXES

	9.1 Tenant shall pay its proportionate share of all real
property taxes and general and special assessments levied and
assessed against the land, the building and other improvements of
which the Premises are a part.  Tenant's proportionate share shall
be the ratio of the total real property taxes levied and assessed
against the land, the building and the other improvements of which
the Premises are a part, that the total number of square feet in
the Premises bears to the total number of square feet of the 
building within which the Premises are located.  Prior to July 1 of
each year, Landlord shall notify Tenant of Landlord's calculation
of Tenant's proportionate share of the real property taxes. Tenant
shall pay its proportionate share of the real property taxes in
equal quarterly installments on or before August 1, October 1,
January 1 and March 1 of each year.  The Tenant's proportionate
share of the real property taxes shall be apportioned for any 
partial term year.

	9.2  Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay before
delinquency (and, upon five (5) days of written demand by Landlord,
Tenant shall furnish Landlord with satisfactory evidence of the
payment thereof) all taxes, fees and assessments of whatsoever kind
or nature, and penalties and interest thereon, if any, levied
against Tenant's property or any other personal property of 
whatsoever kind and to whomsoever belonging situate or installed in
or upon the Premises, whether or not affixed to the realty. If at
any time during the term of this Lease any such taxes on personal
property are assessed as part of the tax on the real property of
which the Premises is a part, then in such event Tenant shall pay
to Landlord the amount of such additional taxes as may be levied
against the real property by reason thereof.

	9.3  Tenant shall pay when due all taxes, assessments or fees
for which Tenant is liable and which arise directly or indirectly
from Tenant's operations at the Premises. Within five (5) days of
written demand from Landlord, Tenant shall furnish Landlord
evidence satisfactory to landlord of the timely payment of any such
tax, assessment or fee.

	9.4  If at any time during the term of this Lease, under the
laws of the United States, Nevada or any political subdivision
thereof, a tax or excise on rents or other tax (except income tax),
however described, is levied or assessed by the United States,
Nevada or any political subdivision against Landlord on account of
any rent reserved under this Lease, all such tax or excise on rents
or other taxes shall be paid by Tenant.

	9.5  Whenever Landlord shall receive any statement or bill for
any tax, payable in whole or in part by Tenant as additional rent,
or shall otherwise be required to make any payment on account
