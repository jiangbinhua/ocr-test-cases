36.  In establishing the interest rate of ten and one-quarter
percent (10.25%) for STATE STREET's Class 3 secured claim the
Court relied upon the following:

(a) The prime rate on August 4, 1994, was
seven and one quarter percent (7.25%), consisting of
the base rate on corporate loans listed by at least 75%
of the nation's thirty (30) largest banks;

(b) In order to determine an appropriate
interest rate for this secured loan the prime rate must
be increased to account for risk factors which include:

(1) Substantial risks created because of the
property's location in a high crime, gang area, and
gang activity on the property itself;

(2) The loan term is six years;

(3) There is no equity cushion to protect
STATE STREET's security interest;

(4) The property requires substantial
deferred maintenance or refurbishment;

(5) The property is in constant need of
repairs and maintenance;

(6) The Debtor's expert witness testified
the "standard commercial loan" would receive an
interest rate of prime plus two or three percent
(9.25% to 10.25%), and loans on apartment
complexes are high risk and high maintenance loans.
