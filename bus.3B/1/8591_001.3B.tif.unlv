Students admitted to a graduate program at the University ar^e expected to continue high
academic standing in any courses completed before they enroll. We require a final transcript
of your complete cour^s^ewo^r^k no later than three weeks after completion of the work. Failure
to obtain the bachelor's degree prior to enrollment at the University will invalidate your
acceptance. A current student of the University of Texas at Austin is ^no^t required to present a
transcript of work completed after this acceptance was issued since that record is available
to the ^ad^mi^s^sio^n^s staff.
You may begin your enrollment only in the semester indicated. If you do n^o^t enroll in that
semester, you mu^st submit a new application ^form ^and any additional transcrip^ts or test
