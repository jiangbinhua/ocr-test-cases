^One of my ^go^a^l^s at the United States Mint o^ve^r the p^a^s^t year has been to
encourage o^ur talented staff to creatively r^e^a^c^h beyond the limits of ^our traditional
offerings. I am proud of the results. ^Our limited edition coin sets offered earlier this
year were enthusiastically sought by coll^ectors.  I hope you agree that we have hit
the target again.
It gives me great pleasure to announce the l99^5 American ^Eagle Proof Coins
with the traditional favorites including the gold ^four coin set, bu^t also with an
exciting new collection, The Philadelp^hia Set.
The ^P^hi^l^a^d^e^l^p^h^i^a Set celebrates the bicentennial of the Phila^del^phia Mint
^and consists of the three gold fractional coins ^an^d the silver one ounce coin produced
at the ^P^hi^l^a^d^e^lp^h^i^a Mint in 199^3.  In addition, we have included a special bonus - a
silver medal minted to mark this important occasion. This special ^P^h^i^l^a^d^e^lp^hi^a
Bicentennial Medal will only be available in The Phila^delphia Set.  Please review the
enclosed brochure ^fo^r all the details.
You will be pleased to know that despite the recent surge in the price of gold,
we have held o^ur prices. ^And ^for almost every coin, we have maintained l^a^st year^'s
^low mint^ages.
This offering presents yet another opportunity - the Pers^i^an ^Gulf ^Veterans
National Medal. ^Our goal in offering this congressionally authorized bronze medal is
to give everyone the opportunity to express their appreciation to the men ^an^d women
