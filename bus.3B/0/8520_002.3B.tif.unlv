talking about on November 1^6.  ^W^ai^t^le^y^'^s topic^:  ^*Being a Team Learner.^*
No, ^no^t team ^*leader.^*  Team ^*learner.^*  Team learning is cropping up
everywhere as the hope ^for the ^l^9^9^0s.  Fortune magazine says, ^*Forget your
^tir^ed old ideas about leadership.  The ^mo^s^t successful ^w^o^r^k^pl^a^c^e of the l^990s
will be something called a learning organization.^*
We ^c^o^u^l^d^n'^t be ^mo^re excited about what ^Dr^. ^Waitle^y is bringing to ^u^s^.
Considering the incredible concentration of political an^d economic uphe^avals
since late 19^89 a^n^d the accelerating velocity of change symbolized by the
^n^ear^n^e^s^s of the year 2000, we a^r^e challenging ^Dr^. ^Wa^i^tley to show us how to
keep ^p^a^c^e^.  We want to know how to create a ^wo^r^k^p^l^a^c^e with strong^er, mor^e
results-oriented ^t^eamwo^r^k, greater ingenuity, ^m^o^r^e positive, constructive
attitudes, superior communications skills a^nd a true understanding of what it
t^a^ke^s to create an extraordinary motivatio^n^al environment.
^W^a^i^tl^e^y says, |It ^won't ^c^o^me from the overly simple business buzz wor^ds of the
^80s, no^r will it be in the buzz wo^rds the ^90s ^are bringing.  Business is
becoming too complex ^a^nd cycle times a^r^e growing too short ^for a single leader
(the 'grand strategi^st') to 'figure it ^ou^t' anymore.  It ^ta^kes learning teamsl^n
^*Back up ^for a minute a^nd think of those times in your life when you felt the
mo^s^t needed, the ^mo^s^t w^a^n^t^ed, ^a^nd the ^most motiv^ated^.  ^More than likely, you
were p^ar^t of a great ^te^am^,  Whether it was an athletic team, a work unit, or a
social ^club|-you were in a group whose members depended on one another ^and
compensated ^for each o^t^h^e^r'^s limitations.  There was only one goal, ^a^nd it was
larger ^and ^mo^re important than your own.  ^Most of us will spend the r^e^s^t of ^o^u^r
lives trying to recapture that spirit.  The ^ironi^c ^p^ar^t is that this ^s^a^m^e
spirit is immediately available to everyone.  The sam^e ^e^x^h^il^a^r^at^i^o^n a^n^d
fulfillment will ^fl^o^w when each individual makes a commitment within himself or
herself to b^u^y into the idea that 'the b^u^ck stops with me.  I am America; I am
the deficit; I am industry; I am my elected official; I am my government; I am
my company; a^n^d I am my own social security '  With this attitude, each of us
is a fully invested team player who wastes no time fixing the blame on others.^*
You ^a^nd your co-wor^kers ^c^an sha^r^e a special three hours with D^r^. W^a^itley from
9:00 ^a^.^m^. to noon on how to ^b^e^co^m^e a team learner.  Lunch will be provided
between noon ^a^nd 1:30 p.m^.  Du^r^i^n^g the l^as^t p^art of the luncheon, yo^u'll get a
very big bonus^:  a special presentation by ^D^r. Waitley^, titled ^*Finding Balance
Between My Work ^a^nd My Family.^u
In a ^sold-o^ut ^*Lessons in Leadership^n program held recently at the University
of ^I^n^d^i^a^n^a^p^ol^i^s^, ^Kathy ^M^il^l^e^r, a manager of co^s^t accounting a^n^d one of 76
^e^m^pl^o^y^e^e^s who attended from Naval Avionics Center, complimented ^Dr^. ^W^a^i^tl^e^y ^fo^r
raising her ^nawareness of leadership principles to .^.^. lead me into the next
decade.^*
^Kirth ^Roa^c^h^, a manager of engineering inspection, one of 39 ^employees attending
from the City of I^ndi^a^n^a^poli^s, said^;
^*Dr. ^W^aitley is a dynamic speaker whose altruistic personality is very
apparent through his demeanor.^*
