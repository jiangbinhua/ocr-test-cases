thousands of conservatives across the n^atio^n who stood together
in 1980, 198^4 a^nd 1988. ^Republicans, ^Independents ^a^nd ^HReagan
Democrats^n who s^h^are o^ur values m^ust unite in one effort to
protect the gains we have m^ade since 1981.
That's why I am hoping we ca^n count on you ^fo^r muc^h needed
support in the difficult weeks ^a^nd months ahead. Believe me, ^o^u^r
s^t^r^ug^g^le against the liberal forces now occupying Washington is
going to be long ^an^d hard.  Think about it^!  Liberals now control
the ^White House, Congress, the federal bureaucracy, the media,
^Hollywood, TV a^nd academia.
A^n^d they ^a^re moving quickly to turn their election victory
into an all ou^t attack on what's left of the ^Reagan Revolution.
^Unless we unite ^a^nd act quickly, we c^an expect to ^see:
* a massive ^r^e^di^s^t^r^i^b^u^t^i^o^n of income from your po^c^ket
to the pockets of those who wish to turn America into
one large social welfare state;
* Governmental policies which, in ^f^a^c^t, promote the
breakdown of family ^a^nd patriotic values;
* A weak foreign policy ^and military that ^take^s America
back to the days when even two-bit Third World
^d^ic^t^a^t^or^s laughed at the ^United States.     '
^Think back to the campaign ^fo^r just a minute. Bill C^l^i^n^to^n
promised ^a^nd promised that no matter what he did he would ^not
increase taxes on the middle class.  Any increases, he said, would
only apply to those making $200,000 a year or mo^re. When we
looked at his numbers, we concluded that he was, in fa^ct,
planning to increase taxes ^no^t just on the ^'rich,^' bu^t on people
making less than $^36,000 a year.
His response then was ^cl^e^a^r ..... the charge was a ^HDirty
Trick^' a^nd we were all lying.  That was then, of ^c^o^u^r^s^e^, an^d now
he admits that under his plan the middle class will have to pay
^a^nd pay heavily.
Well, I intend to do all 1 ^c^a^n to prevent this from
happening.
^Bu^t those of us who mus^t ^fight this batt^le on the floor of
Congress cannot win without outside help..... help from people
like you ^a^nd organizations like the American Conservative Union.
The AC^U is America's oldest ^a^nd mo^st respected conservative
public interest organization.  It was founded in 196^5, ^an^d since
