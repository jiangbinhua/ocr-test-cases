then has been on the cutting edge of every major policy ^b^at^t^l^e^.
The ^A^C^U has the determination ^and the experience necessary
to be the ^po^i^n^t guard in ^o^u^r war against the current liberal
regime.
In 1965, the ^A^C^U began building a conservative coalition
which lead to the election of ^Ronald ^Reagan in 1980. In 1976,
the AC^U ^w^o^n a landmark ca^se in the Supreme Court barring OS^HA
from conducting wa^r^ra^n^tl^e^s^s searches of small businesses. In
1983, the ^A^C^U was the leading organization opposing the national
movement ^fo^r a nuclear freeze.
A^n^d now, in its fourth d^ec^ade, the ^A^C^U is one of the
leaders in ^o^u^r efforts to return conservative ^ideolog^ies ^and
ca^n^di^d^a^tes to power within the next two to ^f^ou^r years.
Again, 57^% of the Americans voting la^s^t November voted
against Bill Clinto^n. The liberals have no mandate to ^t^ax a^nd
spend the American people into oblivion. They have no mandate to
^d^i^sm^a^ntl^e the ^U.^S. military.  A^n^d they have no mandate to
assault your individual rights in the name of radical
e^nv^ironmentalism, racial ^guotas or any other left-wing pipe dream.
^But they have control of the House ^a^nd Senate, a
sympathetic media a^n^d the ^f^ull support of ^Hollywood an^d
America's left-wing intellectual ^elite^. That's why you ^a^nd I
have ^o^u^r work c^u^t o^u^t fo^r ^u^s, a^nd why I hope I ^c^a^n count on you
to join me as a f^ull partner in the American Conservative Union.
Just as I need your help, the ^A^C^U needs your support. By
including a ^do^nat^io^n of ^$^2^5, ^$^5^0, $100 or ^m^o^r^e to the ^A^C^U along
with your completed 1993 National Issues Survey, the ^A^C^U will be
able to help me ta^ke the ^b^a^t^tle to the liberals.
Together we c^an wi^n. With your help, the ^A^C^U will:
* build public support against higher taxes on working
|      Americans;
* ^form a ^*Truth Sguad^n to inform the American people
each time the Clin^ton Administration breaks a
campaign promise;
* reunite the political coalition that resulted in
three consecutive conservative Presidential l^a^n^d^s^l^i^d^e^s^;
* recruit millions of Americans horrified by the liberal
