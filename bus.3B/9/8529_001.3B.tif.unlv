Thank you ^f^or your call; it was a pleasure speaking with you.  l am delighted to learn of your interest in
SYSTA^T products.
SY^STAT 5.0 ^f^or Windows t^akes ^f^ull advantage of Windows, with ^pull-^down menus, dialog boxes, sizable
windows, ^and the eas^e of use you expect in a Windows package. Just ^poin^t ^a^nd click; ^S^Y^$^T^A^T'^s
QuickStat^i*| buttons give you simple, single-click ^s^h^o^r^t^cu^t^s to common statistical analyses.
^SYSTAT output ^c^an be viewed on-scre^en, edited, ^cu^t, copied, ^and p^a^s^t^ed to other Windows programs.
SY$TAT|$ new comprehensive ^o^n-li^n^e help system includes explanations of SYS^TA^T command^s^,
functions, ^a^nd procedures. You ^can even access information on a particular topic by searching on a
key ^w^o^r^d^.
Since Windows allows you to open several windows on the desktop at the ^s^ame time, ^y^o^u'^ll be able to
view data ^a^nd graphics side-by-side. Also, data an^d graphics ar^e fully integrated in ^SY^ST^AT ^fo^r
Windows: ^y^ou'll be able to click on data point^s ^a^nd instantly view the c^a^se^s in your data set that
correspond to t^hose point^s.
SYSTAT^'$ interactive graphics let you do mor^e than just calculate statistics. You c^an explore your
dat^a in new ways ^and from a variety of ^p^er^s^p^e^c^t^iv^e^s.  ^For example, you c^an use the l^a^s^s^o ^t^o^ol to
select a subset of data ^and exclude ^o^u^tl^y^i^n^g ^p^oi^n^t^s^, ^an^d with just a few clicks create a graph of the
subset.  ^Or^, rotate plots to view data from different ^p^e^r^s^p^e^c^t^iv^e^s^, revealing new i^n^si^gh^t^s about
^d^i^s^tr^i^bu^t^i^o^n^s a^nd factors. SY$TAT^'^$ analysis is equally interactive. ^Fo^r example, you ^c^an substitute
one variable in an analysis or graph with another to explore data in new ways. To compare results,
simply display graphic differences.
SYSTA^T ^f^or Windows runs in standard ^and 386 enhanced modes ^and ^takes advantage of Windows
advanced memory management. By operating ^SY^STAT ^fo^r Windows in extended memory m^o^d^e^, ^y^ou'll be
able to analyze very l^a^r^g^e a^nd complex problems. ^SY^STAT c^an handle an unlimited number of records
^and up to 256 v^a^r^i^a^bl^e^s in a single data ^f^il^e^. An^d^, as with ^a^ll SYST^A^T products, ^SYSTAT ^for Windows
command ^and data fil^e^s ^are compatible with ^SY^S^T^A^T ^for DOS, Mac ^and ^v^A^x/^vM^S.
^SYSTAT requires Windows 3.1 or higher running in standard or extended modes, with a minimum of 2 Mb
RAM ^and 6 Mb of available disk space. A mouse, ^c^o-^pr^o^c^e^s^s^or ^and additional memory ^ar^e recommended
bu^t no^t required.
