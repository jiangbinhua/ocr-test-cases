As a special service to ^o^ur Discover ^C^ar^d^me^mb^er^s^, we asked the ^All^s^t^a^t^e
Life Insurance Company to help ^solv^e a problem shared by a great number of
families today - perhaps even your^s.
The problem is simply this. Mo^st of us ^are expected, sometimes ^Leq^g^ge^d,
to carry adequate in^surance on things we own, such as ^o^ur homes, c^ars ^a^nd
other pos^sessions^. ^But very few of us carry enough insurance ^for ^our mo^st
valuable asset of all - ^o^u^r ^M^e - ^and that's what ^o^u^r families depend on the
^m^o^s^t^!
You probably already carry a certain amount of life insur^ance. ^Bu^t if you^'re
like mo^st people, once you have some^, it's very easy to ^pu^t it ^ou^t of your mind
^a^nd ^no^t ^se^e the possibility of needing ^m^o^r^e. Even with the ^c^o^st of living rising
moderately, if the value of your present insurance remains fixed, you may no
l^o^n^g^e^r have the protection that you originally in^tended.
You may already recognize that no^t having enough l^i^f^e in^sur^ance could be
somewhat dangerous - especially when you consider the number of changes
that t^ake place in your l^if^e that ^c^a^n create the need ^f^or m^or^e ^i^n^su^r^a^n^c^e
protection. ^F^or example, a young, growing family usually means growing
financial responsibilities. A new home, or l^a^r^g^e^r ^income, usually requires
additional protection. Perhaps ^y^o^ur^s is a two-income family, ^a^nd you b_o^m need
adequate l^i^f^e insurance. Or you might be raising a family alone, in which c^a^se
insurance protection is doubly important.
Perhaps you Q se^e the need ^f^or m^or^e i^n^s^ur^a^n^c^e protection, ^b^ut have
^w^o^nd^er^ed how you c^an ^fit it within your budget.
We understand that concern. So, when we set ^out to help ^solve the
problem, ^our objective was to have ^All^s^t^a^t^e develop an insurance plan that offers
you ^and other eligible Discover ^C^ardmemb^ers protection, flexibility, ^a^nd
a^ffordability.
First of all, we w^anted to provide an insurance plan that would give you
solid protection at aff^grdable rates.
We also thought you should be offered a ^eh^ei^ee gf benefit ^am^g^gn^t^e
($25,000, $50,000 or $^100,000) to best suit your own particular needs. Plus, it
seemed important that the amount of coverage should ne^t decrease ov^er the
years, as you often find with ^s^o^m^e other li^f^e insurance plans.
^(^ov^er, please)
