w would you like to have your own personal designer/draftsperson^?  Someone to design anything you
^w^a^n^t^e^d, anytime you wanted^?
Whenever you needed help, your designer would lay ou^t your ideas on paper, then refine them until they
were just r^i^g^h^t.  ^And after you looked at what they^'d ^do^n^e, if you w^a^n^ted to make ^s^o^m^e changes, they' d
finish them in a second or two. Your designer would even pu^t in dimensions, specifications, ^a^nd work up
a bill of materials f^o^r you.
Your designer could help you ^se^e things ^l^ike inter^ior space layouts ^for an office, or maybe an addition to
your home BEFORE you start the project. Maybe, like me, ^you'v^e been thinking about ^some do-i^t-yourself
landscaping, a^nd it would be great to have a c^lear ^ma^p of what the yard would look like before you bu^y
the supplies.
If you have lot^s of projects in your head that ^y^ou'd like to ^put on paper before you start them, b^u^t no time
or interest in drafting, then I have ^s^o^m^e great news ^f^or you.
Your Drafting Assistant Is Waiting ^f^or You, ^an^d Its Name I^s...
.^..^Tu^r^b^o^C^AD fo^r DOS, Windows or Macintosh. Now you ^can ^pu^t any project you ^c^a^n imagine on paper, easily,
accurately, ^a^nd fast! ^And you c^an make changes to your plan as often as you want, without expensive
alteration charges. The secret^: ^TurboCAD, a state-of-the-art ^C^AD ^(^Co^mpu^ter Aided Design) software
package that's geared to YOU, the individual user, as well as corporate professionals.
The fac^t is, ^Tu^r^bo^CAD has virtually all the powerful ^t^oo^l^s that design ^a^nd engineering professionals
enjoy in their ^t^o^p-^o^f-^t^h^e-^l^i^n^e^, expensive ($500 a^nd up) ^C^AD programs. It even reads the sa^me .DX^F ^f^i^le^s^.
The only real differences between Turbo^CAD a^nd high-priced ^C^AD programs:
1. ^Tu^rbo^C^AD is easy to learn a^nd use ^for real people w^ho have never used C^AD before, as well as having all
the ^t^o^ol^s that the experts want.  Expensive programs like ^Auto^C^AD| ^are ^much harder ^f^or regular people
to use.
2. It runs under DOS, Windows or Macintosh - your choice. The Windows version ^ta^ke^s ^f^u^ll advantage of
Windows power, convenience, speed an^d ^e^ase of use. ^Bot^h offer ^p^u^l^l-^d^o^w^n menus, o^n-^l^i^n^e help,
^f^u^l^l-^c^o^l^o^r capability ^a^nd all the other features ^y^o^u'^d expect in a sophisticated ^C^AD program ^c^o^st^i^n^g
thousands ^mo^re^.
3. YOU ^c^a^n afford ^T^urbo^C^AD, even if you a^ren'^t a defense contractor. Now, ^you'll be able to do all your
personal design projects with a package that fits your budget.
