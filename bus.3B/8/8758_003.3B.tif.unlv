layer. Then you ^c^an easily a^d^d or delete any layer, or move it up or ^do^w^n in the ^"stack" of layers. Take the
layer ou^t ^and ^s^ee what it looks like without i^t^; then return the layer to your plan.
M^ost importantly, you ^don't need any skill at all in drafting, design, or drawing to^c^reate professional, highly
accurate, useful designs. I know, because I c^an barely write legibly, yet l^'v^e designed several projects myself
with TurboCAD^, includin^g the home ofl^ice from which l^'^m writing to you ri^gh^t now.
What T^u^r^b^o^C^A^D Is Really Like To Use
Let me "talk you through" what it's like to use ^T^u^r^bo^C^AD yourself. Let's use my back yard project that
I recently completed. Because I have ^b^ot^h the DOS ^a^nd Windows versions, I tr^ied it on ^both^. Windows
or DOS, it ^d^o^e^s^n'^t make any difference.
^B^u^t, let me ^t^e^ll you howl did it using the Windows version. First, I took the measurements of my back
yard directly from the plot plan that ca^me with the title to the house. Next, I talked with the ^l^a^n^d^s^c^a^pe^r
about what he had in mind.
Then It Was Time To Sit ^D^ow^n at the PC
Using the handy ico^n ruler on my screen, I simply clicked my mouse to set the scale of the drawing, then
drew the first property line by moving the mouse. I clicked on a second ^i^co^n to define the distances ^and
angles, which I took from my plot plan. I ^pu^t in different point^s using the pre-de^fi^ned distances, ^an^d
Turbo^C^AD drew complete lines that exactly matched the irregular shape of my lot. Each time I did so, the
edit b^ar at the to^p of my screen tol^d me what my current settings were, ^and the status ^bar at the bottom
to^ld me exactly where I was.
I then used the ^s^a^m^e poi^nts again to set up the dimensions of a standard pr^efabric^ated ^dec^k...t^he one the
contractor could build ^mos^t economically ^for me.
I clicked my mouse to open the Construction Details ^S^y^m^bo^l^s Library, ^and p^u^t in sliding ^gl^a^ss ^d^oo^r^s to the
deck. I clicked again to open the Landscaping Syr^nbols Library, ^a^nd pulled ^out the ^b^u^sh^e^s ^a^nd flower bed
syr^nbols I w^a^n^t^e^d^. Then I started to get slick, ^an^d ^pu^t in a hatching texture on the deck. By now the plan
began to really look like something, so I called my wife to ta^ke a look. Right away, she saw so^me ways to
improve the deck ^a^nd the landscaping so that they ^f^it better with ^o^u^r lifestyle.
I could barely believe i^t^! TurboC^AD had ^m^ad^e a real difference in my own project, ^and within hours after
I started using it^.
Just as impressive as ^T^u^r^bo^C^A^D^'^s usefulness ^for personal projects is what it does ^fo^r professionals.  I took
TurboC^AD to my next door neighbor, an electronic engineer who does ^C^AD work all d^ay. Using only his
home PC ^an^d Tur^bo^C^AD, he read ^a^nd modified ^s^o^m^e .D^X^F ^f^il^es he brought home from his office.  He even
liked a few things about the T^urbo^CAD interface better than the ^AutoCAD| he usually uses.
