4. It runs on virtually any PC. That means any machine with at least 6^40K base RA^M ^a^nd a hard drive.
Your designs will print o^u^t on any dot matrix or l^ase^r printer, too. You ^d^o^n'^t need a plo^tter.
Test Turbo^CAD's ^F^ull Spectrum Design Power Yourself Risk Free
Whether ^y^o^u'^r^e a "Power User^" or ^n^o^t, ^T^u^rbo^C^A^D is ^fo^r you. Even if you do^n'^t do mor^e now with your
PC than ^word processing ^an^d the occasional sp^readsheet, you should t^ry o^u^t ^T^u^r^b^o^C^AD.
In ^fact, I'd like you to ^try ^TurboCAD's Computer Aided Design power on your ^o^v^i^m design challenges,
with your ^o^v^m PC, risk ^f^r^e^e. The reason fo^r this great offer is ^si^m^pl^e^:
I KNOW ^y^o^u^'l^l go crazy ^o^v^e^r your new-found design freedom!  That's why we invite you to tr^y ou^t ^T^u^rbo^C^AD
now with no obligation f^or 60 days. At the end of that time, if you ar^e ^no^t completely satisfied with
^T^u^r^b^o^C^A^D, you simply return it ^fo^r a ^f^ull refund.  It's that simple!
This trial offer is obviously a great deal.  ^But the real reason ^yo^u^'^l^l keep ^Tu^rb^o^CAD is because of what it does.
So let me t^ell you ^m^o^r^e.
Design Anything!
Using ^T^u^r^b^o^C^A^D, you ca^n design, ^and mor^e importantly, refine all kinds of projects. ^Y^o^u'^l^l get better results
because you s^ee what the "finished product" will look ^l^i^1^<e before you start your work.  You ^can effortlessly
change your design until it's just rig^ht...before you commit valuable resources.
You ^c^an use your PC to convert your imagination into shapes, dimensions, spaces, areas, ^flows, ^s^y^m^b^o^l^s,
connections, a^nd ^m^o^r^e. A^ll with precision ^and blinding speed.
In ^f^a^c^t, it's so ^good at what it does, ^you'll find yourself comin^g up with mo^re ^g^ood ideas than you
thought possible.
What 1^<ind of projects is Turbo^CAD ^good for^?  How about:
I^n^t^e^r^i^o^r layouts ^fo^r home a^nd office                                 Network diag^rams
^Floor plans f^o^r new buildings a^nd addi^t^jons                             Plumbing ^d^i^a^g^r^am^s
Printed circuit board sc^hematics                                   Electronic diag^rams
Landscape design                                                       Technical d^i^agr^am^s
Furniture layouts                                                          ^I-^`^l^o^w charts, schedules an^d mo^r^e^!
Model design
I'd ^s^a^y if you ^can visualize ^i^t, ^and you want it precise, then it's a ^Tu^rboCAD project.
What ^T^u^r^b^o^C^A^D Is...
^T^u^r^b^o^C^AD is a complete design ^tool. It gives you an easy way to sketch your ideas, then automatically
turn them into complete, detailed drawings, with accurate, written-in dimensions, specifications, ^a^nd
even a list ^for a bill of materials. With Tu^rboCAD, you ca^n draw an^d dimension any kind of detailed design.
^Turbo^CAD is a cinc^h to learn a^nd use. You ^can draw standard ^and irregular shapes to scale. Then ^pu^t in
the details you want using optional T urbo^C^AD libraries of standard objects. You c^an accurately size each
ob^j^ec^t, like a ^c^o^u^c^h, a ^tr^ee, a window, a PC, or se^wer on a network of ^P^C'^s^. Then you c^an move each
individual item around at will, to ^se^e how it will ^fit an^d look in different places.
Better yet, ^T^u^r^b^o^C^AD gives you the key ^t^o^ol of ^t^o^p-^o^f-^t^h^e-l^i^n^e ^CA^D programs: layers, up to 256 of them.
Layers work just like transparent overlays on t^o^p of a drawing.
You ^pu^t as many elements, like ^c^o^u^c^h^e^s, ^r^e^s^i^s^t^o^r^s, lines, arrows, polygons or whatever, as you like on each
