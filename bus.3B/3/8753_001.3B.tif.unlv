its powe^n^`ul Maple symbolic engine whenever possible.
New Mat^hcad 4.0 gives you the ^c^or^e of Maple, today's ^mo^st powerful symbolic m^a^t^h too^l from the University of ^W^a^t^e^r^l^o^o, Canada.
With just a menu click, ^for example, Math^cad c^an simplify a formula or so^lve ^for a variable. There is no need to learn a programming
language, just ^po^i^nt a^n^d click. The symbolic answer is ready ^for numerical calculations or ^furth^er symbolic transformation.
A ^Mo^re Useful Benefit to You Than Even Time Savings
Of ^c^o^ur^s^e^, using your PC to do all the routine work will save you a considerable amount of time. ^B^ut new Mat^h^ca^d 4.0 will do ^fa^r
^more than that. It will allow you to sol^v^e problems ^much ^more effectively a^nd efficiently.
Because ^mat^h with ^Mat^h^cad is so ^m^uc^h easier, y^o^u^'^l^l do mor^e of it as ^p^ar^t of each problem you ^s^o^l^v^e. Your answers will be ^m^o^r^e
accurate. An^d y^o^u^'^l^l do ^m^or^e "what i^f^" calculating than you ^bo^ther with now.
