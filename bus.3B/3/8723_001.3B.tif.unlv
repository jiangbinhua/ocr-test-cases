Las^t month, I joined the Urb^ana-Champaig^n campus as Chancellor ^a^nd b^ec^a^m^e
the newest member of a large ^and ^prestigious group--advocates ^for the University of
Illinois.
My ^job as Chancellor is to preserve ^an^d enhance the long tradition of
excellence in teaching, research, ^and service at the University of Illinois at Urban^a-
Champaign. As you know, the University is ranked as one of the best in the ^n^a^t^i^o^n-
^a^nd the w^orld-bec^au^se of the breadth ^and ^quality of ^o^u^r programs. We confer 9,000
degrees a year, we have m^or^e than 85 research centers, ^and we serve ^n^e^a^rl^y a million
Illinois citi^zens each year with public service programs. Maintaining the ^quality of
^o^u^r programs is essential if we ar^e to retain ^o^u^r prominence among higher education
institutions.
Two of the many assets that make the University ^g^r^e^at--^our Library ^and

Fund has been designated to receive gifts that will be used to support these areas. I
would like to explain why these areas ^a^re important to ^u^s, ^an^d I hope after reading
this letter you will support this year's Advancement Fund.
The University Library is second to none among public university libraries in
the n^ation. Its 14.4 million items ^ar^e housed in the main Library building, the
Undergraduate Library, ^and 43 departmental libraries. The University's ^Slavic,
music, mathematics, ^and ^m^ap c^o^l^l^e^c^t^i^o^n^s ^are world famous, as ^are its collec^tions of
^rare books, m^anuscripts, ^a^nd personal papers.
The accessibility of the University Library is unequaled among research
libraries. Users anywhere in the world c^an browse through the catalog via ^mode^m.
The Library's size, breadth, a^nd accessibility bring benefits beyond those
immediately apparent. ^F^or example, the Library is a magnet that draws ^an^d holds
distinguished scholars on ^o^u^r faculty. Hundreds of businesses a^nd governmental
