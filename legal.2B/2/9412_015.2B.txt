In re:

MAGIC CANYON HOMES, LTD,

Debtor.


CASE NO : BK-S-95-20507 LBR
CHAPTER 11

DATE : N/A
TIME : N/A


  EX PARTE MOTION FOR EXAMINATION OF CONSOLIDATED
MORTGAGE COMPANY AND ITS RELATED COMPANY, VOUCHERS, INC.

  Debtor, Magic Canyon Homes, Ltd. ("Debtor" herein), hereby
moves this Court for an order granting the examination of
Consolidated Mortgage Company.  Debtor filed a petition under
chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, 11 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.,
on or about the 9th day of February 1995.  The schedules and
statements of affairs show an asset of an undetermined amount owed
by Consolidated Mortgage Company to Debtor.  It is the belief of
Debtor that Consolidated, and related entities, including but not
limited to Vouchers, Inc., took actions which prevented Debtor from
completing its development project and has resulted in the need for
the present bankruptcy.  Debtor also believes that Consolidated and
related entities are holding funds of Debtor which should be turned
over.
