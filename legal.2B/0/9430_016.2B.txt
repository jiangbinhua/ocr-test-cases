fact should be considered conclusions of law, they should be
construed as such.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

 1.  GMAC has not met its burden of proof under 11 U.S.C.
523(a)(2), (a)(4), or (a)(6) by a preponderance of the evidence
and therefore the obligation of the Debtor is discharged.

 2.  The Debtor did not obtain money, property, services
or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit by false
pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud under 11
U.S.C. 523 (a)(2)(A), or by the use of a statement in writing
that was materially false respecting his financial condition on
which the creditor reasonably relied and that the Debtor made
with an intent to deceive under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(2)(B).

 3.  The Debtor did not engage in fraud or defalcation
while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny
under 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(4).

 4. The Debtor did not commit willful and malicious injury
to another entity or to the property of another entity under 11
U.S.C. 523(a)(6).

 5.  An injury is "willful" for nondischargeability
purposes if the debtor intended to perform the act complained
of.  In re Britton, 950 F.2d 602, 605 (9th Cir. 1991).

 6.  An injury is "malicious" for nondischargeability
purposes if the debtor had actual knowledge or it was reasonably
foreseeable that his conduct would result in injury to the
creditor. In re Britton, 950 F.2d 602, 605 (9th Cir. 1991).
