5. Public Relations:  Press releases announcing the availability of the center will be

E. Sales Management:

The entire sales effort for Nellis Trails will be directed by Robert Lipman, Director of The
Crown Partnership, Inc.. Mr. Lipman is a broker with 20 years experience in marketing
properties on a national level.  Upon completion of the sales kit, Mr. Lipman will direct his
energies, as well as the energies of his assistant, to exposing Nellis Trails to the maximum
number of people in the shortest period of time.  Through diligent efforts, Mr. Lipman will
monitor the canvassing and follow up, analyze financial and market data and make any
necessary changes to our marketing strategy.  Once potential buyers are identified, Mr.
Lipman will then apply the necessary negotiating pressures to see to it that the sales price is
the absolute maximum price attainable.

In the way of review, The Crown Partnership, Inc. is recommending a four part program that will
begin with the proper positioning of Nellis Trails for sale and culminate with the sale of the
property at the highest possible price.  The program we have laid out incorporates marketing and
selling themes that have proven successful during our years of experience.

SECTION V. THE CROWN PARTNERSHIP, INC.

The Crown Partnership, Inc. was founded in New York City by Robert Lipman and myself in July

Wakefield for 15 and 12 years respectively.  During our years at Cushman & Wakefield, we
learned and refined the art of marketing property and applying negotiating skills to successfully
complete sales transactions in the shortest period of time.  Our New York office, located at 6
Water Street in Manhattan, specializes in commercial leasing, mortgage brokerage and investment
sales.  Once properly positioned within the market place, state of the art computer analyses and
extensive data based investor lists will assure us of receiving the highest possible price for Nellis~ 
Trails Shopping Center.

At The Crown Partnership, Inc., we are proud of our accomplishments and capabilities.  We have
always focused on completing assignments in a timely and professional fashion and will be highly
recommended by those on both sides of the transactions we have represented.  A complete list of
references is attached and you can feel free to contact any of these parties.  As you will note, I 
have made a career of representing both tenant and landlord and have been involved with many
major corporations.

Experience is always an important factor in negotiating complex lease transactions.  I am proud of
my experience and accomplishments however, I add an additional dimension to this assignment. I
will assure you that my firm will not take on any competing property to yours, that is, we will not
solicit or accept exclusive sales listings on similar properties within the Nellis Boulevard corridor
until the successful completion of this assignment, thus eliminating any potential for a conflict of
