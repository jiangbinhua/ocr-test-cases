Tenant shall pay to Landlord basic monthly rent of
($ ) Dollars; provided that if the lease term
includes a fractional month, for that fractional month Tenant shall
pay as basic rent that proportion of the basic monthly rent due
which the number of days in said fractional month bears to the
total number of days in said month.
After each lease year the basic rent for the succeeding
lease year shall be adjusted for any increases in the cost of
living in the manner hereinafter provided.  No adjustment shall be
made for decreases in the cost of living, if any. Landlord shall
compute the increase in the cost of living for the preceding period
based on the U. S. All Cities Average Consumer Price Index for
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers for all items (1982-1984),
published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U. S. Department
of Labor.  Landlord shall compute the rent adjustment by 
multiplying the basic monthly rent for the preceding lease year by
a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the index number for
the month immediately prior to the first month of the lease year
for which such adjustment is made and the denominator of which
shall be the index number for the month immediately prior to the
first month of the preceding lease year.  In the case of the
adjustment at the end of the first lease year the denominator shall
be the index number for the calendar month immediately preceding
the commencement date hereof.  The product so obtained shall be the 
adjusted basic monthly rent.
