UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT

DISTRICT OF NEVADA


In Re:

JOHN H. O'NEILL
SARA M. O'NEILL


BK-S BK-S 94-25039 LBR
Chapter 7

EX PARTE MOTION FOR AN
ORDER APPROVING PAYMENT
OF TRUSTEE EXPENSES

No Hearing Required Pursuant
to Rule 2002 (a) (7)


 RICHARD A. DAVIS, Trustee of the above entitled estate, moves this
court for an order allowing him to reimburse the Trustee for actual
expenses incurred of $53.93.  The Trustee has a balance of funds on
hand of $300.31.  Attached hereto as Exhibit "A" is an itemized state-
ment of the actual expenses incurred by the Trustee.
 The Trustee requests that the court approve his motion to allow
payment of actual out-of-pocket expenses ($53.93) to the Trustee.
The Trustee believed this to be an asset bankruptcy, but has found the
only asset to be $794.00 auto equity.  There are $65,862.00 in unsecured
debts and the Trustee does not believe it cost effective to Notice
Creditors to file claims, therefore, the Trustee will file a no-asset
report with the court.
