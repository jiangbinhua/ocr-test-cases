due unpaid rent.  It is specifically understood and agreed that
acceptance by Landlord any partial payment, or of any rental
payment which is less than the entire amount of rent then due from
Tenant, shall not constitute a waiver of Landlord's right to
terminate this Agreement for non-payment of rent or other non-
performance.
 (c) If Tenant abandons the leased premises,
Landlord may inventory, move, and store, at Tenant's expense, any
personal property left on the leased premises by Tenant, and, after
thirty (30) days, Landlord may dispose of such personal property in
the manner allowed by law in order to recover any reasonable
expenses incurred in such storage.
 11. (a) Tenant shall not make or permit or suffer to be
made any alterations to the leased premises or any part thereof,
without prior written consent of Landlord, or change or add any
lock without providing Landlord with a key for emergency use and
other lawful entry.
 Any such additions or alterations of the leased premises,
except movable furniture, shall become a part of the realty and
belong to Landlord, unless Landlord gives Tenant written notice at
the end of the term to remove some or all such additions or
alterations, in which case Tenant shall, at his own expense,
restore the leased premises to their original condition. Tenant
shall not attach any sign to or suspend any sign from outside of
the leased premises without Landlord's advance written consent.
